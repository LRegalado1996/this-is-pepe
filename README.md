## 🧑‍💻 About Me

### 💻 Web Developer | Lifelong Learner | Passionate Collaborator

I'm **Lucas "Pepe" Regalado**, a software developer passionate about creating, learning, and helping others grow. I believe that development goes far beyond code—it's about building with purpose, connecting ideas and people to generate real impact.

**👨‍👧 Dad first, developer second.** Balancing work and raising my daughter teaches me daily about empathy, patience, and creativity.

**⚽ Sports enthusiast:** I support **Club Nacional de Football**, Uruguay's biggest club 🇺🇾💙, and recently became a **Formula 1 fan**, enjoying the excitement of each race even without a technical background.

### ✨ What I Enjoy

- **Helping turn ideas into real products** – from concept to deployment
- **Mentoring, teaching, and learning in a community** – sharing knowledge and growing together
- **Creating projects with a human-centered, simple, and sustainable approach** – technology that serves people

### 🚀 Currently

- Working at **Streaver**, building impactful solutions
- Exploring new ideas and personal projects
- Collaborating with other creators to build purposeful products

I strongly believe in giving back, sharing knowledge, and helping others achieve their goals. Code is just a tool; the real aim is to build something meaningful together.
