import { Title } from "@/components";

export default function ContactPage() {
  return (
    <div className="w-full max-w-[1280px] p-4">
      <Title className="mb-4">Contact Me!</Title>
      <p>
        My basic idea is to implement several react libraries, which serve as a base for anyone
        looking for a hand
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
