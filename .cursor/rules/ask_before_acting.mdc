# Always Ask Before Acting

Before making any significant changes to the code, you must:

1. **Explain** what you plan to do
2. **Ask for confirmation** from the user
3. **Wait** for approval before proceeding

This ensures that all changes align with the project's goals and the user's expectations.

## Examples of significant changes:
- Creating new files or components
- Modifying existing functionality
- Refactoring code structure
- Installing new dependencies
- Changing configuration files
- Deleting code or files

## Exceptions:
- Minor formatting fixes
- Obvious typo corrections
- Changes explicitly requested by the user
