# SOLID Principles

All code must follow the SOLID principles of object-oriented design:

## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class or module should have only one reason to change. Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility.

**Example**: Separate data fetching logic from UI rendering logic.

## O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Design code that can be extended without modifying existing code.

**Example**: Use interfaces and abstract classes to allow new implementations without changing existing code.

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application. Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

**Example**: Ensure derived classes don't change the expected behavior of base classes.

## I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Create specific interfaces rather than one general-purpose interface.

**Example**: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

**Example**: Use dependency injection and rely on interfaces rather than concrete implementations.
