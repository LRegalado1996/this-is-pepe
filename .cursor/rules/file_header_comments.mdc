# File Header Comments

Every code file in the project must include a comment at the beginning that explains its purpose and functionality.

## Requirements:

1. **Location**: Place the comment at the very top of the file
2. **Language**: Write in English
3. **Content**: Clearly describe what the file does and its main responsibility
4. **Conciseness**: Keep it brief but informative (1-3 lines typically)

## Format for different file types:

### TypeScript/JavaScript/React
```typescript
/**
 * Header component that displays the navigation menu with links to main sections.
 */
```

### CSS/SCSS
```css
/**
 * Global styles and CSS variables for the application theme.
 */
```

### Configuration files
```javascript
/**
 * ESLint configuration for enforcing code quality and style rules.
 */
```

## What to include:
- Primary purpose of the file
- Main exported component/function/class
- Key responsibility or functionality
- Any important context (optional)

## What NOT to include:
- Author names (use git history instead)
- Creation dates (use git history instead)
- Excessive implementation details
- Redundant information obvious from the file name
